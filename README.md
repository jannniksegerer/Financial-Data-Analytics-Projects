## Project 1 - unconditional, conditional estimates and sharpe ratio:
This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of five selected stocks from 2000-01-01 to 2021-12-31 using YFinance. The primary tasks involve calculating and displaying the four moments of each stock and observing their characteristics. Additionally, conditional estimates for the first two moments will be calculated using appropriate methods, comparing the results with unconditional estimates during both crisis and non-crisis periods. Finally, based on their respective return and risk profiles, I will determine the most suitable stock for the crisis periods as well as for the overall period.
In conclusion, this comprehensive analysis will provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the selected stocks during different market conditions, particularly crisis periods. The findings will aid in making informed investment decisions and identifying potential strategies for managing risk during turbulent economic times.

## Project 2 - risk contribution and dependencies with the Fama-French Factors:
This research project aims to analyze a portfolio of selected companies by calculating their risk contribution based on covariance. Additionally, it assesses the exposure of the top 10 and lowest 10 risk contributors to Fama-French Factors (RMRF, SMB, HML) throughout the entire timeline. The study aims to identify patterns and distinctions in risk and factor exposures, providing insights for portfolio optimization and risk management strategies.

Furthermore, the identified high-risk and low-risk companies will be clustered based on their Fama-French factor exposure patterns. By analyzing the dependencies between the obtained clusters and the risk categorization, this study seeks to gain a deeper understanding of how the companies' exposures to specific factors relate to their risk levels. 

## DowJones - Project: 
This research project represents my initial foray into programming with Python and focuses on the analysis of Dow Jones data. The primary objectives of this study encompass the provision of general market information and real-time news updates. To enhance data visualization, price plots accompanied by trendlines are employed to illuminate historical price trends effectively.

Additionally, the project delves into an in-depth analysis of three distinct trading strategies, assessing their performance over the period from 2017 to 2021. This critical evaluation seeks to derive profound insights into the effectiveness and impact of each strategy on investment decision-making.

Furthermore, a mini correlations analysis is conducted to explore the potential predictive capability of past price patterns on the present-day price movements. This rigorous examination aims to unveil any discernible relationships between historical data and current market dynamics.
